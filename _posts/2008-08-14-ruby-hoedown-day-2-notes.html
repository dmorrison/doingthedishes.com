There were problems, but overall it's impressive.] </li>    <li>Example apps:      <ul>       <li>Yelpvox - call a #, then get surrounding restaurant information </li>        <li>SendSign - real estate flyer information service. If flyer box is empty, call the provided # to get information. Can then go to SendSign.com, enter in the phone # that you called from, and see the homes that you looked for. </li>        <li>Frucall - do online comparison shopping by calling a number and entering in a barcode of a product while you're in the store. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>What you need to get started:      <ul>       <li>Asterisk or FreeSwitch (available in virtual machine format) </li>        <li>Text to speech engine </li>        <li>SIP provider </li>        <li>DIDs (phone numbers) </li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <h2>Ruleby: The Rule Engine for Ruby</h2> Joe Kutner   <ul>   <li>We're used to imperative programming. </li>    <li>It's nice, but the programmer should, ideally, understand all of the entire program (which is often impossible with imperative programming). </li>    <li>Alternative: rules engines, rules-based paradigm </li>    <li>Write rules declaritively, but don't specify how code runs. </li>    <li>Ruleby uses a Ruby domain specific language (DSL) to specify rules </li>    <li>Uses the Rete algorithm. Good, but exchanges memory for speed (be aware of this). </li> </ul>  <h2>flog &lt;&lt; Test.new</h2> Rick Bradley   <ul>   <li>Flog - continuous integration for code complexity. </li>    <li>Evolution of a programmer:      <ol>       <li>Lamer </li>        <li>Haxor </li>        <li>Cowboy </li>        <li>Embryo (start to notice testing) </li>        <li>Webelo </li>        <li>Poseur (half-heartedly do testing) </li>        <li>Human </li>        <li>Apprentice </li>        <li>Journeyman </li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>Test driving code in a greenfield scenario is much more different than testing existing code. </li>    <li>Technique: don't change existing code without test covereage. </li>    <li>Legacy code = code without tests (Michael Feather's book Working with Legacy Code) </li>    <li>[Comments from the audience: This may just unnecessarily confuse the terms &quot;untested code&quot; and &quot;legacy code&quot;. What if old code is well tested? Rails 1.0 is well tested, but is still legacy code.] </li>    <li>So, for an existing app without tests, where do you start? Very basically, on the outside, pealing away layers. </li> </ul>  <h2>Archaeopteryx: A Ruby Midi Generator</h2> Giles Bowkett   <ul>   <li>[Presentation starts with live demo of electronic music driven by a Ruby script and edited live in a text editor to change the music's style.] </li>    <li>I'm a former DJ. </li>    <li>A lot of DJs are using laptops now, which should in theory, make computer geeks popular at parties. </li>    <li>Venture capitalism is like the patronage system for artists and is stifling. </li>    <li>Programmers are often distracted by shiny toys. </li>    <li>Be profitable from the start by being small and cheap. </li>    <li>I'm trying to create my own niche market using Archaeopteryx and MIDI controllers for DJ work. </li>    <li>This is your brain on music book. </li>    <li>I'm going to test my program by running it for 7 days at Burning Man. </li>    <li>Good business is the best art. -Warhol </li>    <li>[For sure it's an entertaining presentation, but there are too many rat holes and it comes off to me as scatter-brained.] </li> </ul>  <h2>Lightning Talk: What Can We Learn?</h2> Yahuda Katz   <ul>   <li>Ruby <u>can</u> be used in the &quot;enterprise&quot;. </li>    <li>While I don't want to use Rhino or Hibernate, we can learn a lot from Java's experiences. </li>    <li>Whereas Ralis embraces convention whole-heartedly, Merb has good defaults set on a highly configurable backend. </li> </ul>  <h2>Keynote: Ghosts of Ruby</h2> David Black   <ul>   <li>The Ruby language did, in fact, exist before Rails. </li>    <li>Presently, version 1.8.6 has the highest adoption. </li>    <li>1.8.7 is a strange, present/future 1.8.6 with backported 1.9 features. </li>    <li>1.9.0 is not in widespread use. </li>    <li>1.9 features      <ul>       <li>New Enumerable methods. There are lots. </li>        <li>BasicObject - knows nothing, above Kernel in the class heirarchy. </li>        <li>New lambda literal constructor          <ul>           <li><b>-&gt; () { }</b> </li>            <li>A way to have blocks with method argument paramter semantics. </li>            <li>Ex:<b> -&gt; (a, b=1) { b } </b>is like <b>lambda { |a, b=1| }</b> except that this is kinda invalid because how can you distinguish b=1 from the bitwise or operator. </li>         </ul>       </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>[Points out several things he finds personally peculiary in 1.9] </li> </ul>
