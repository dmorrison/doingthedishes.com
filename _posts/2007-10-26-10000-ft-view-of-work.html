title: 10,000 Ft View of Work

<p><img height="332" alt="" src="/images/db-dependencies.png" width="338" /> </p>  <p>We've been testing out an excellent suite of database tools for SQL Server here at work from <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate Software</a>, and I captured this image while using their SQL Dependency Tracker tool. What you're seeing is a very high-level view of the database for a project I'm working on. Each one of those tiny dots is a database object (table, view, stored procedure, etc), and the lines between them show relationships. The layout is the one automatically generated by default. </p>  <p>I haven't used many database or code analysis tools like this, so it was striking to see such a high level (and admittedly pretty, in an abstract art sort of way) view. </p>
