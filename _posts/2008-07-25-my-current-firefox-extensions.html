title: My Current Firefox Extensions
---
<p>I got a new machine at the office towards the beginning of this week, and I've spent the last few days installing and tweaking software. A lot of settings can be exported and imported with many programs and operating systems these days, so in a certain way having to reconfigure things seems like a waste of time. But recently I've been relying on defaults more and more, and I can also use times like this to re-evaluate what settings and tools I really need.</p>  <p>Maybe I'm becoming old and curmudgeonly, but I'm finding that I don't have the stomach anymore to spend tons of time tweaking and optimizing software settings. I was pleased to find that I've settled on the following Firefox extensions after a few days of heavy use on the new machine:</p>  <p><a href="/images/firefox-extensions-2008.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="570" alt="FirefoxExtensions" src="/images/firefox-extensions-2008.jpg" width="454" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>(And, actually, I could probably do without FaviconizeTab).</p>  <p>I might end up adding or taking away a few here and there, but I think this is a good sign that I can get up and running with Firefox 3 quickly and that it provides a lot of functionality by default.</p>  <p>As a side note, this reminds me of a Coding Horror post on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001077.html">The Dark Side of Extensions</a>.</p>
