title: Heart touching video power

<p>
Why do video cards always have such melodramatic artwork on their packaging? I understand that most of them are produced in Asia and they&#39;re trying to appeal to their target audience (gamers), but still. I got a new card in the mail today for my unstable <a href="/post.aspx?id=bfc1754a-358e-4e88-b3cf-1ff268371e2b">media center PC</a> today, and here are a few pics from its box [more]:

The card is rock solid and heart touching...<br />

...as well as &quot;Splendid Video Intelligence Technology&quot;...<br />
