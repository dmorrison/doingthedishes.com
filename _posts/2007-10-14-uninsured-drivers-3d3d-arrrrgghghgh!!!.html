title: Uninsured Drivers == Arrrrgghghgh!!!
---
Jamila was involved in an accident today where an uninsured driver without a tag tried crossing a turning lane that Jam was in and hit her head-on. Luckily she&#39;s ok, but is bruised up a little. Pics are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekmorrison/sets/72157602426625769/">here</a>. Cop said that the accident was the guy&#39;s fault and that he would give the guy a ticket and suspend his license for driving without insurance and a tag, but the chances of getting any money out of him for Jam&#39;s (probably totaled) car are slim.
