title: Upgrading to an SSD
---

I recently upgraded the hard drive in my laptop (a [Western Digital Blue, 640GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136459)) to an SSD ([OCZ Vertex 3, 240GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227707)). I'd heard how much an SSD improves performance, and I can now definitely vouch for this; the upgrade has been a substantial boost for my aging mid-2009 MacBook Pro (Intel Core 2 Duo 3.06GHz, 8 GB RAM).

During the course of the upgrade, I did a couple before and after benchmarks.

### Boot Times

First, I took some very informal measurements of boot time. I routinely boot into Windows using Boot Camp for work, so I have boot times for both Windows 7 and OS X Lion.

*Windows 7*

- From boot menu to desktop: 
	- Before: **1:15**
	- After: **0:29**
- To launch Firefox
	- Before: **2:13**
	- After: **0:40**

*OS X Lion*

- From boot menu to desktop
	- Before: **1:12**
	- After: **0:17** (17 seconds!!!)
- To launching iTunes
	- Before: **1:44**
	- After: **0:29**

### CrystalDiskMark

I also took before and after measurements using [CrystalDiskMark](http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html) (a disk benchmarking utility for Windows).

### Windows Experience Index

Lastly, here are the results from the Windows Experience Index utility on Windows 7.
