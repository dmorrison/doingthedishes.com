title: Mobile UI Influence

I noticed a couple tweets floating around today about [leaked images](http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-office-15-full-metro-ui-screenshot-leaks) of UI in an upcoming version of Microsoft Outlook that mimics the Windows Phone 7 "Metro" UI style:

Also, keep in mind the demos of the upcoming OS X Lion that Apple's been showing off (the Launchbar feature is shown here, which looks the same as folders on iOS):

It's interesting to see desktop OSes taking major cues from mobile UIs.
