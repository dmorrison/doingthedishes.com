title: Jason Fried on Running a Flat Company
---

Interesting [take][t] on employees inevitably progressing into management from Jason Fried of 37 Signals:

>We always try to hire people who yearn to be master crafts people, that is, designers who want to be great designers, not managers of designers; developers who want to master the art of programming, not management.

This kind of view would probably be hard for most companies to swallow, but it's a compelling idea for someone like myself who's interested in becoming the best they can be at their craft (at least for now).
