<p>I've had good luck using Gmail. It's fast, fairly simple, and is available anywhere I have an internet connection. Also, I switched over to using it for my work and school email (using Gmail's POP3 access feature and some forwarding) probably about a year ago and it's worked well - I access all my email accounts from one place.</p> <p>I saw a really helpful feature today that, while it may not be that new or even original, saved me from making an embarrassing common mistake.</p> <p><a href="/images/WindowsLiveWriter/GmailLove_A618/Gmail%20Attach%20Warning_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="263" alt="Gmail Attach Warning" src="/images/WindowsLiveWriter/GmailLove_A618/Gmail%20Attach%20Warning_thumb.png" width="565" border="0"></a></p> <p>I'm assuming that it guessed this by my message hint, but I could be wrong. Either way, it made me put on a geeky smile.</p>
