title: New site look
---
I just set up a new and improved theme for the site using a free <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/EliteCircle1-1/index.html">template</a> and adapting it manually to work with my blog. <a href="http://dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.NET</a> comes with several good themes, but none of them were exactly what I was looking for (and I also wanted an excuse to dig into the blog code a little more). It was a lot of fun to do, and, while looking through BlogEngine.NET&#39;s source, was very interesting to see how ASP.NET is supposed to be done :). There are probably still a few rough edges, so please excuse the mess.
