I&#39;m trying to get my personal site in order, and I&#39;ve decided to launch this new blog to get things under way. The site&#39;s been neglected for quite awhile now, so now I&#39;m hoping to give it the attention it deserves and have a little fun in the meantime. [more]<br />

<h4>Personal Update</h4>
<p>
All in all, things have been going very well at home. Jamilya and I still aren&#39;t sure of a wedding date, although we&#39;re tentatively shooting for the first half of next year (need to get on the ball about this one). However, we&#39;re still a very happy couple&nbsp; I&#39;d say (and hopefully she would too), and I think she&#39;s learned to put up with my geeky quirkitudes very well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;ih=017&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMESO%3AIT&amp;viewitem=&amp;item=270142472393&amp;rd=1">sold</a> my motorcycle. It was sad to see her go, and she was a great bike, but I just wasn&#39;t riding enough lately. Riding on the streets became less and less <a href="http://www.waff.com/Global/story.asp?s=6629355">appealing</a>, and although <a href="http://www.sportbiketracktime.com/">track days</a> are great, they can be a little <a href="http://www.sportbiketracktime.com/cart/shopexd.asp?id=596">pricey</a>. Maybe I can manage to get a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/SUZUKI-SV650s-Track-Race-bike_W0QQitemZ260150493832QQihZ016QQcategoryZ9808QQcmdZViewItem">dedicated track bike</a> in the future and ride just there (where there are no cars, trees, or fence posts and everyone is going in the same direction).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Having sold my bike, with extra cash in hand, and with an expiring Verizon contract, wasn&#39;t it only natural that I get an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>? I won&#39;t bore with too many details (as I think <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/technology/circuits/27pogue.html?ex=1340596800&amp;en=98d00bf6e780b2be&amp;ei=5088">enough</a>... <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117168001288511981-euxzmjNFZTZhA_2z8OBtD6GK900_20070224.html?mod=blogs">has</a>... <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2082361,00.asp">already</a>... <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smart-phones/apple-iphone-4gb-at/4505-6452_7-32180293.html">been</a>... <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/apple/no-bs-iphone-review-276116.php">written</a> about one of the most highly-anticipated consumer electronics devices in history). It was funny, however, when I called Verizon to cancel my contract and port my phone number -- The operator asked me why I was leaving Verizon and if there was anything they could do for me to make me stay. I simply said &quot;iPhone&quot;, and the lady excitedly asked me how I liked it and told me that, in this case, she totally didn&#39;t blame me for leaving Verizon (true story!). The thing has been great so far, and is a real joy to use.

I&#39;m still pursuing my masters at Auburn (in software engineering), and I&#39;m slowly but surely fulfilling my 33 required hours (my just-completed summer class made my total 17). I&#39;m taking it at the relaxed pace of one class per semester, and this, with work, gives me ample time to concentrate on each individual class. Even though it&#39;s tiring to come home and watch streaming video courses, then keep up with homework and assignments after a brain sapping day at work, I&#39;m thankful for them, as they keep my neurons firing about exciting areas of software engineering. It&#39;s also been interesting to see how I&#39;ve been able to apply my, albeit limited, work experience to courses in ways that I was too ignorant to do while I was an undergraduate student.
</p>
<p>
In my last class (on software environments), I was able to experiment with creating a custom plug-in for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> development environment. For this, I created a stripped-down duplicate of <a href="http://egcs.javaforge.com/">this</a> plugin from scratch (with the teacher&#39;s approval of course - the idea was to get an overview of Eclipse&#39;s architecture), which calls the Google Code Search web service to search for relevant source code within the development environment. The Fall semester just started, and I&#39;m taking a class on formal methods for software engineering, where I&#39;ll be learning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_notation">Z specification language</a>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still enjoying my job at <a href="http://www.asi-hsv.com/">ASI</a>, and am still working on back-end web development using ASP.NET. On my current project, we&#39;ve been able to explore several interesting areas of <a href="http://asp.net/ajax/">AJAX</a> development, as well delve into some intersting data acess <a href="http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/020806-1.aspx">patterns</a> using Visual Studio 2005. I&#39;ve been there for a little over a year now, and it&#39;s turned out to be a great environment where I&#39;ve learned a lot.&nbsp; 
</p>
<h4>Site Technical Background</h4>
<p>
Since I stopped using Blogger many months ago, I&#39;ve had several ideas for using different blog platforms to create a new blog and personal site. Since I work with Microsoft technologies and ASP.NET, I wanted to stay close to home, so I investigated a few .Net blogging platforms (<a href="http://www.subtextproject.com/">SubText </a>and <a href="http://www.dasblog.info/">DasBlog</a>). In fact, the previous version of the site was made using SubText as a prototype. While these are very established and capable projects, I was looking for something a little more stripped down and easier for me to get my head around.
</p>
<p>
I also experimented with creating a custom web application that used the web solely for data storage, with a private Blogger account storing my blog entries (as, I think, William Gibson&#39;s <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">blog</a> does), and my other bits of information (blogroll, amazon wish lists, videos, music lists) stored somehow online too. I went down this path for awhile, but then an up and coming .Net blog engine called <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.Net</a> caught my eye. It&#39;s aimed towards simplicity, and I delving into the source doesn&#39;t seem, to me at least, as intimidating as other .Net blogging platforms.
</p>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>
I have a few major purposes that I hope this site will serve as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A place to share my personal info (personal blog entries, pictures, movies and music lists)</li>
	<li>A place to share professional or technological bits
	</li>
	<li>A test area for experimenting with new technologies (<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx">VS 2008</a>, AJAX, BlogEngine.Net customizations, <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>, etc)</li>
	<li>A playground for experimenting with web design</li>
	<li>A way for me to work on writing skills</li>
	<li><u>Not</u> a system that makes me feel pressure to write necessarily lengthy (or even frequent) entries.<br />
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Roadmap</h4>
<p>
Things I have planned for the immediate future are:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Create a custom theme that uses the blog&#39;s standard functionality using <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3559">this</a> theme (maintaining complete compatibility with BlogEngine .Net&#39;s theming mechanism).</li>
	<li>Fork development on this custom theme and create a site that I can more heavily customize.<br />
	</li>
	<li>Integrate custom parts into the site (such as a Flickr badge, del.icio.us list, and last.fm list).<br />
	</li>
</ul>
That&#39;s all for now. I&#39;m in the middle of a few computer upgrades now, so I&#39;ll have details on this coming in a bit.
