title: A Quote from Luke Wroblewski
---
<blockquote>
<p>There's nothing wrong with writing down specifications, but I would say write them down once you've actually worked through some of the issues - that's the fundamental problem. If you can work through some of the issues with Keynote, great. If you can work through some of the issues with a lightweight HTML and JavaScript prototype, great. If you can do that on paper, more power to you.</p>
<p>Until you can actually do that, you're pulling things out of thin air and it's going to lead to a lot of re-doing and iteration anyway, so you might as well get that iteration done up front.</p>
