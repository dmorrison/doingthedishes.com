title: A Quote from 37signals

<blockquote>
<p>...then, if you cut down one or two more words, the sentence has gone from being clear to being really, really brief. Sometimes, people - I think programmers do this quite a bit -&nbsp;mix up the idea of being concise and compressed with being clear. ... Brevity and clarity are two different things.</p>
