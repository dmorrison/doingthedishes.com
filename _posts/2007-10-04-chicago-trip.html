title: Chicago Trip
---
Jam and I took a trip to Chicago the other weekend with our friend Sergey, and I have the (extremely mediocre) pics <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekmorrison/sets/72157602259346411/">here</a>. It was a great trip, and Chicago was beautiful. For more professional pics, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deimoss/sets/72157601943869726/">here</a> is a set that Sergey&#39;s friend Evgeny (who we hung out with there) took.
