title: We're On Google Street View
---
<p>While I was looking up directions to my house on Google Maps to give to someone, I noticed that I've been indexed by Google Street View. It amazes me that they have the resources to shoot even my little house.</p>  <p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=199+Hollington+Dr+NE,+Huntsville,+AL+35811,+USA&amp;sll=34.760477,-86.528063&amp;sspn=0.007192,0.012681&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cbll=34.75941,-86.527412&amp;panoid=ThS1_pyYDOzagRY3dxMehg&amp;cbp=1,96.28029603768823,,0,7.739927358404969&amp;ll=34.763209,-86.526657&amp;spn=0.007783,0.009763&amp;z=17">Here</a> it is. Note that it may be a little off (just go North about 9 clicks until you see the blue truck out front on the right).</p>
