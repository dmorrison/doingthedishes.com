What is CodeMash? From the site: </p>  <p>&quot;CodeMash is a unique event that will educate developers on current practices, methodologies, and technology trends in variety of platforms and development languages such as Java, .NET, Ruby and PHP.&quot; </p>  <p>Although I mostly work with ASP.NET and Microsoft technologies in general, I still like to keep my eyes open to what other tools and perspectives are out there. Really looking forward to being immersed in a diverse environment like this for a few days.&#160; </p>
