title: Four Rules
---
<p>
...for software project management. I heard these on a <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=438">recent episode</a> of .NET Rocks titled &quot;Pat Hynds On Why Projects Fail&quot; (skip to around the 13:00 minute mark - are the intros long enough on this show or what??).

<ol>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - if you&#39;re not paranoid earlier, you&#39;re going to be unhappy later.</li>
	<li><strong>Never Assume</strong> - always make sure requirements are clear between you and the customer.<br />
	</li>
	<li><strong>Don&#39;t Be Wishful</strong>
	- a project is not done until after the coding is done and lots of
	other things happen. When asked if a project is done, you should be
	able to definitively say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; (without any &quot;Yes... but....&quot;
	responses). You must confirm with the customer that the project is done.<br />
	</li>
	<li><strong>No Spec, No Estimate</strong>
	- many people want a fixed-bid price when they give a time and
	materials spec. Make sure that a detailed spec is given by the client.
	Include what will <u>not</u> be done.</li>
</ol>
