My Dad, who&#39;s been suffering with severe back pain for the past several years, just got a <a href="http://www.medtronic.com/neuro/paintherapies/pain_treatment_ladder/neurostimulation/neuro_neurostimulation.html">neurostimulator</a> implanted along his spinal cord yesterday. For the time being, he has wires sticking out from his back and controls electrical impulses to his back and spine with a wired remote. However, after the initial trial period, he can get a fully internal apparatus which is controlled with a wireless remote (the internal batteries are said to last around 9 years). So far, he says the results are good, and hopefully this will allow him to depend less on pain medication. Dad&#39;s been having a rough time with his back for awhile now, and I really hope this helps in even the slightest way to alleviate his pain.

I remember hearing about these devices several years ago on the news as an upcoming technology, and I&#39;m amazed that Dad&#39;s doctor was able to get his hands on one this soon. In a way, also, I&#39;m a little jealous - I wsh they would hurry up with the iPhone headset implants (and I&#39;m only half joking).
